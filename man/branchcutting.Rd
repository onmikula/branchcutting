\usage{
branchcutting(
  phy,
  psample,
  heterosp = NULL,
  consp = NULL,
  rescale = TRUE,
  bw = "mdif",
  kernel = "epanechnikov",
  outgroup = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phylogenetic tree with branch lengths supplied as an object of class \code{phylo},
a character string in newick format or a name of file with the tree in newick or nexus format.}

\item{psample}{a posterior sample of trees as a list of \code{phylo} obbjects, \code{multiPhylo} object,
or a name of file with the trees in newick or nexus format.}

\item{heterosp}{a two-column matrix with rows containing tree tips constrained to be heterospecific
or a name of tab-delimited file containing such matrix.}

\item{consp}{a two-column matrix with rows containing tree tips constrained to be conspecific.
or a name of tab-delimited file containing such matrix.}

\item{rescale}{logical, whether to rescale branch lengths (default is TRUE).}

\item{bw}{a character string indicating bandwidth function or a number giving the bandwidth;
defaults to \code{mdif}, a bandwith calculation rule designed to the problem in hand.}

\item{kernel}{a character string indicating function used in the kernel density estimation,
defaults to \code{epanechnikov}, but see \code{\link[stats:density]{stats::density()}} for other options.}

\item{outgroup}{a character vector with outgroup names or their unique identifier(s).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bcut} or, if only \code{psample} is supplied,
a list with components \code{support} (support for various delimited species), \code{classification}
(definition of the species) and \code{consensus} (data frame with the consensus species delimitation).
}
\description{
The function \code{branchcutting} delimits species on a single tree and/or
a posterior sample of trees using branch-cutting algorithm.
